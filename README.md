CursedMinecraftPlugin
Welcome to CursedMinecraftPlugin! This Minecraft plugin adds tons of hilarious and cursed features to your game. Get ready for chaotic fun, as this plugin messes with Minecraft in ways you never thought possible. From absurd mobs to quirky mechanics, you’ll experience Minecraft like never before. Some features are already live, and many more are on the way – stay tuned for future updates!

#### 🚀 Features
Here’s a sneak peek at some of the cursed and funny features that are already implemented:

Walking Beds: Ever been tired of sleeping in the same spot? Now your bed will randomly walk away when you're not looking!
Exploding Chickens: Why should only Creepers explode? Chickens now have a chance to go BOOM when approached.
Anti-Gravity Blocks: Forget about gravity! Some blocks float randomly into the air, creating spontaneous floating islands.
Dancing Mobs: Certain mobs will randomly stop what they're doing to have a dance-off. Watch out for breakdancing Creepers!
Backward Swimming Fish: Fish now swim in reverse. They might be trying to evolve... or maybe they're just confused.
Random Mob Sounds: A zombie might sound like a cow, and a sheep might sound like a Ghast. Prepare for unexpected soundscapes!
#### ⚙️ Planned Features
This plugin is still in development, and more cursed features are on the way! Here’s what you can look forward to:

Teleporting Grass: Stepping on grass may randomly teleport you to a different part of the world. Watch your step!
Reverse Mining: Break a block and it grows back, but in reverse. Time to rethink your mining strategies!
Random Item Stacking: Some items will stack in unusual amounts. Have fun trying to carry 327 cobblestone in one stack!
Flying Pigs: Pigs will take to the skies and rain chaos from above.
Uncontrollable Boats: Boats may suddenly decide to steer themselves. Good luck with that ocean crossing.
Talking Animals: Some animals will have... opinions. They might even roast you!
And much more to come...
